# General Call Guidelines
1. Remember, your own safety comes first as a responder. If you
were to get injured or hurt the follow up emergency services
would potentially have 2 patients rather than one.

2. Always try to remain calm even if you are nervous. The
responders demeanour often translates to the patient and patients
family/bystanders.
3. Apart from a chest pain call there is no other call where a Cfr has
to administer meds.
4. 300mg{1 tablet} of Aspirin {Disprin} chewed is all we as Cfrs
have in our possession to administer if the criteria is met for chest
pain.
5. For stroke calls all we can do as responders is gather information.
Like, when symptoms started, what are symptoms, FAST
assessment etc.
6. For ALL Calls, **TRY** to have any meds the patient takes regularly
or on prescription ready and available for the ambulance crew.
Also advise any family members present to pack a bag with a few
essentials in case of being admitted, phone charger, night clothes
etc.
8. Make sure at least one responder stays with the patient at all times. It is often better if one or two responders stay with the patient while the rest waits outside. Use your own judgement and respect patient's privacy. 
8. Relax, Enjoy the buzz of helping, and everything will fall into
place.

**Note:** For new Responders I would recommend attending as
many as possible when others are going even if just to
observe, even if numbers are sufficient, youâ€™ll learn far
more at call outs than at a training scenario
