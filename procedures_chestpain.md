# Chest Pain Call Out Checklist 

After receiving the text alert and you have either used the responder app to say you were attending and on scene etc or replied to the text with the codes, please use the following purely as a GUIDELINE on what to do while with the patient.

- Introduce yourself as a first responder and ask who and where is the patient
- All while checking for scene safety, again introduce yourself to the patient, ask how they are feeling and to describe the symptoms.
- Upon gaining this information, and all the while remaining calm, rule out the contra-indicators for aspirin.
  - **A**ge{over 16}, **a**ctive bleeding ulcer or bleeding disorder and known severe **a**llergic reaction, or has **a**lready taken aspirin (in connection with the chest pain)
- Give the aspirin if all criteria is met and instruct patient to chew it into a paste. You can give them a little water after they have chewed it to help get rid of the taste. 
- Note the time that aspirin was given, write it on glove as is easiest.
- Continue with conversation and reassurance to the patient in a calm manner, all the while monitoring the patient and there level of alertness etc.
- Advise family members/ friends to pack a small bag for the patient in case patient will be transported, include night clothes, socks and jocks, phone charger etc.
- **NOTE**: Neoc can be rung at any stage throughout the process quoting the incident number and updates on patients condition or ETA of ambulance obtained.

Remember, you are there to TRY to help, not all calls are hands on chests but mainly information gathering for the ambulance crews. Remain calm and don't run around, always walk and reassure the patient and family that they have done the right thing by ringing an ambulance as its always better to be save than sorry.
