# Lesson Plan: Chest Pain Scenario (Encouraging Experience Sharing)

Objective:
By the end of the 50-minute session, participants will understand how to respond to chest pain calls, focusing on assessment, aspirin administration, monitoring, and handover. The lesson will foster collaboration between experienced and new CFRs through shared experiences and interactive activities.
Duration: 50 minutes

Materials:
- Projector and screen
- Presentation slides (chest pain scenario)[https://github.com/Lock19CFR/docs/blob/b9ce6ce27bf8b58297320f40d2d23d5ca329f219/training/Chest%20Pain%20Scenario.pptx]
- Visual aids illustrating key actions (previously created images)
- Whiteboard or flip chart for group discussion
- Participant worksheets (optional)

## Lesson Breakdown
 1. Introduction (5 minutes)

    Purpose: Introduce the session and emphasize that both experienced and new CFRs will play key roles in the lesson. Explain the we will go through a scenario describinga chest pain call.

    Key Points:
        Importance of sharing experiences to improve team response.
        Overview of the session's focus on chest pain calls.

2. Scenario 1: Initial Assessment (10 minutes)

    Slide: "Chest Pain Call – Initial Assessment"
        Scenario: You arrive at the home of a 55-year-old man who is pale, sweating, and experiencing chest pain. His wife says the pain began 20 minutes ago.
        Key Actions:
            Ensure scene safety.
            Start with a SAMPLE assessment (Signs, Allergies, Medications, Past history, Last intake, Events).

    Interactive Activity:
        Ask new CFRs to answer the initial questions (e.g., safety precautions, questions for the patient).
        Follow up by asking an experienced CFR to share real-life challenges or additional safety tips during initial assessments.

    Group Discussion:
        Encourage new CFRs to ask questions about the initial encounter, fostering a learning environment where experienced members share their insights.

3. Scenario 2: Administering Aspirin (10 minutes)

    Slide: "Administering Aspirin"
        Scenario: After assessing, you decide to administer aspirin. The patient is not allergic, and there are no contraindications.
        Key Actions:
            Administer 300mg aspirin.
            Ensure the patient chews the tablet.

    Interactive Activity:
        New CFRs discuss the importance of aspirin and the contraindications.
        Experienced CFRs share personal examples of administering aspirin, focusing on patient reactions and challenges.

    Group Sharing:
        Ask an experienced CFR to explain how aspirin administration improved a patient's outcome, or when they faced challenges convincing a patient to take it.

4. Scenario 3: Monitoring and Vital Signs (10 minutes)

    Slide: "Monitoring and Vital Signs"
        Scenario: After giving aspirin, you monitor the patient’s pulse (95 bpm) and breathing. He’s still uncomfortable but stable.
        Key Actions:
            Reassess the patient regularly.
            Keep the patient calm and still until EMS arrives.

    Interactive Activity:
        New CFRs describe how they would monitor vital signs, while experienced CFRs share insights on maintaining calm in nervous patients.

    Pair Sharing:
        Pair an experienced CFR with a new CFR to discuss practical tips for handling anxious patients while monitoring their condition.

5. Scenario 4: Handover to Emergency Services (10 minutes)

    Slide: "Handover to Emergency Services"
        Scenario: The ambulance arrives. You provide details about the patient’s condition, symptoms, and treatment.
        Key Actions:
            Handover the patient record form.

    Interactive Activity:
        Have new CFRs practice giving a handover to the group.
        Experienced CFRs provide feedback, offering tips on clear communication during handovers.

    Role-play Exercise:
        Have an experienced CFR play the role of an EMS paramedic, with a new CFR practicing the handover. The group can provide feedback afterward.

6. Group Discussion: Lessons Learned (5 minutes)

    Slide: "Lessons Learned from the Chest Pain Scenario"
        Key Points: Summarize key actions: assessment, aspirin administration, monitoring, and handover.
        Ask experienced CFRs to share "lessons learned" from their real-world experience.
        New CFRs reflect on what they will take into their first chest pain call and ask questions to clarify uncertainties.

    Group Comment Area:
        Foster an open discussion where both new and experienced members can voice their thoughts, concerns, and strategies.

### Conclusion (5 minutes)

  - Summarize the importance of rapid and calm response to chest pain calls.
  - Reiterate the value of shared experiences and learning from each other.
  - Open the floor for any final questions or comments.
