## Lock 19 Community First Responder Group

We are a groups of volunteers, linked to the National Ambulance Service and despatched by the 999/112 National Ambulance Service to emergencies within their communities.

Community First Responders are only dispatched to cardiac arrest, adult chest pain (suspected heard attack), stroke and choking emergencies in their communities.

Most responder Groups have organised themselves to be “on call 24/7” to respond to these emergencies.

The Groups purchased their own AEDs (Automated External Defibrillators) and training equipment by fundraising;

The training is carried out by The Pre Hospital Emergency Care Council (PHECC) CFR Instructors and the work is carried out by the volunteers who give up their time to be “on call”.

Community First Responders have been trained to perform CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation), how to use an AED, perform aspirin therapy for adult chest pain and carried out a FAST assessment for possible stroke and.

Upon receipt of a 999/112 call Community First responders are dispatched simultaneously with the National Ambulance Service. First Responders are only dispatched to calls within a three mile (5km) radius of their Communities.

Because the people “on call” live or work in their area, they can respond in minutes and provide emergency measures and reassurance until the Ambulance Service arrives.
